# Anomaly-detection-on-Stock-Market
Developed a machine learning model to identify anomalies in stock market data
## Overview

Anomalies in stock market data can signal critical events or unusual behavior. This project employs autoencoders, a type of neural network, to detect such anomalies by learning the normal behavior of stock market data and identifying deviations from it.

## Features

- Preprocessing of historical stock market data.
- Training an autoencoder neural network on normal data.
- Detection of anomalies based on reconstruction error.
- Visualization of results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dev232-rock/Anomaly-detection-on-Stock-Market

The project uses historical stock market data, which can be obtained from financial data providers like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or any other source. The data should include open, high, low, close, and volume (OHLCV) values.

Model Architecture
The autoencoder neural network consists of:

An encoder that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space.
A decoder that reconstructs the data from the latent space.
Anomalies are detected based on the reconstruction error, with higher errors indicating potential anomalies.
Results
The model was able to detect anomalies in the stock market data effectively, providing insights into unusual market activities. The results can be used for early warning systems and to enhance trading strategies.
